Rewrite of Chaos% in C#

I have little experience with C# but the current language used for Chaos% (AutoHotkey, http://www.ahkscript.org) 
is not particularly object oriented which makes dealing with the increasing number of effects more and more cumbersome. 
Obviously there are pro's and con's to a complete rewrite, mainly that this takes a good amount of time to get right, especially
with my limited C# experience. 'Luckily' there are some aspects of the mod that I want to change anyway which already require a 
complete overhaul of the code, so that makes the rewrite less painful. Even so, I don't have all the time in the world and a 
significant part of the free time I do have is spent on other projects (GTA III Toughened Mod) so I can't say when this will be 
finished, if ever (though I currently am intent on finishing this).

Meanwhile I will keep the current version of Chaos% updated in terms of minor stuff, unless I do decide to abandon this I won't 
do big overhauls of the current version. And as always, I'm only working on stuff if I'm motivated to do so since this is all
just a hobby.
