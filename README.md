Chaos_CSharp
============

Rewrite of Chaos% in C#

The language used for the currenlty released Chaos% version (AutoHotkey, http://www.ahkscript.org) 
is not particularly object oriented which makes dealing with the increasing number of effects more and more cumbersome.
There are also a of things that I want to change which require a complete overhaul of the mod anyway, so it seems like a suitable time to switch to a different language.
Obviously a complete rewrite takes a good amount of time to get right, so this won't be finished overnight.
